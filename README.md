Most of my work was done in the MainMenu portion of the project. I wrote most
of the bindings and logic from the UI elements to the code and logic for program.
I also wrote the Deposit, and Withdraw functions of the main menu and connected
them with the other portions of the system.

I worked with Evan to plan out the general flow and components (e.g. classes and corresponding variables/methods) of the ATM. Specifically in the code, I wrote the JSON file, Account class, and AccountList class. I also helped implement the locking of acconts in Login. In the Main menu I did some work redesigning the UI. I added the Check Balance button and contributed to the designed of the Check Balance, Deposit, and Withdraw panels. However, other team members worked on the logic of each button/element within these panels.
